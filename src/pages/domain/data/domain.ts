      'Project Effluo addresses persistent challenges in modern software development, focusing on merge conflict resolution, CI/CD pipeline generation, and context-aware automation.',
      'In DevOps, maintaining and updating pipelines manually remains a burden due to a steep learning curve and lack of automation [1][2]. There is a growing need for solutions that generate and update pipelines based on developer behavior, with minimal input and more control left to users.',
      'CI/CD pipelines also face issues like build failures, poor PR prioritization, and delayed deployments. Tools like BuildFast [3] and metadata-driven PR risk classifiers [4] have improved reliability, yet many teams still merge PRs without proper CI checks [5]. Research shows that context-aware deployment delays and behavior-informed prioritization can significantly reduce post-deployment issues [6][7].',
      'Furthermore, research shows merge conflicts are common in collaborative development, especially with non-modular contributions and multiple authors [8]. While traditional tools support manual resolution, newer approaches use deep learning (e.g. sequence-to-sequence models [9], token-level classifiers, and GPT-based models [10]) to automate and improve precision, though the field is still emerging with few publications.',
      'For semantic conflict resolution, traditional static and dynamic tools often fall short in detecting logic-level issues. Recent advances include program analysis [11], AST-based tools [59], and automated testing [12], with LLMs like GPT-3 offering promising but still limited results due to context constraints [13].',
      'Overall, the literature supports the vision of Project Effluo: a unified, intelligent system that automates merge resolution and pipeline workflows through behavior analysis, contextual awareness, and AI-driven techniques.',
